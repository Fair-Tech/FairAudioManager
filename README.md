# Fair Audio Manager

A temporary home for my Autohotkey version of Fair Audio Manager while I translate it to Python.

If you'd like to try the software, just download the exe file [here](https://github.com/Fair-Tech/FairAudioManager/raw/12b977a25ea9c25e2c14fe1e3d1eb754a5ab8d55/FairAudioManager.exe), as it was compiled with all of the necessary libraries to run standalone.
